Instructions for installing the NAO library can be found at:

http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/python/install_guide.html

However, these may not work for you. A workaround is to simply copy the contents of the naoqi library into your site-packages folder,
which may be located at C:\Users\UserNameHere\Anaconda2_32\Lib\site-packages if you used Anaconda to install.

Some notes:
	1) You must be using 32 bit, 2.7 Python. Python3 will not work with the project.
